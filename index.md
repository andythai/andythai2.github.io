<p>I am currently a <strong>Ph.D. student at UC Irvine studying Computer Science</strong>, advised by <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gopi/" target="_blank">Professor Gopi Meenakshisundaram</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests include computer vision and the application of machine learning techniques to problems in computer graphics (computer animation and non-photorealistic rendering).</p>

<p>I was previously a UCSD undergraduate research assistant in the department of <b>Cognitive Science</b>, where I worked on studies relating to social robotics, animal-robot interaction, and pro-social reciprocity in rodents within <a href="https://medschool.ucsd.edu/education/neurograd/faculty/Pages/andrea-chiba.aspx" target="_blank">Professor Andrea Chiba&rsquo;s</a> laboratory.</p>
